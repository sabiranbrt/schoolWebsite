            <h2>NEB Class 11 and 12 new curriculum and syllabus of all subjects</h2>
            <p>The new curriculum of class 11 and 12, which was enacted from the academic year has been revised. The major issue in the new curriculum was on regards of Mathematics. Mathematics has been included as third subject in alternative with Social and life learning. Now students willing to learn mathematics in class 11 and 12 can choose mathematics. There will be three compulsory subjects i.e. English, Nepali, Social life or Mathematics and four optional subject. The implementation of new course was pended in court for long time which was adjourned by the court with note to make appropriate correction in need.</p>
